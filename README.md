The ability to 3D print with PDMS (polydimethyl siloxane) is extremely useful in the lab for constructing custom lab equipment and devices. We are 3D printing PDMS via a modified ShopBot desktop CNC system. 


###Build Documentation
This git repository includes:
- STL files for 3D printing syringe-mount for the ShopBot
- Current firmware (modified Marlin for pressure-driven extrusion)
- Cura configuration and G-code munging script for G-code creation and processing
- Wiring diagram for electronics configuration (based on RAMBo electronics)
- Instructions for 3D printing with PDMS
