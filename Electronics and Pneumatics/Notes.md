# Pneumatics

Air should flow through the following series of components:

0. Tank or wall (~100 psi)
1. Regulator (~35 psi)
2. Electropneumatic transducer
3. Solenoid valve
4. Tubing to stoppered syringe

The transducer provides (some) pressure control while the solenoid valve rapidly applies and removes pressure to start and stop flow of PDMS.
